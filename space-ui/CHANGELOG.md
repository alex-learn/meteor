Changelog
=========

### 5.0.1
@Sanjo fixed a minor issue #29 with `Space.ui.createEvents`

### 5.0.0
Updates to `space:base@2.0.0` and `space:messaging@1.0.0` (checkout breaking
changes in both packages!). Here is short summary:

#### Upgrade from 4.0
- replace the app/module `run` hook with `startup`
- start your application with `start` instead of `run`
- There is a new `Space.messaging.Api` to define Meteor methods that can be
tested easily. This **replaces** the functionality from `Space.messaging.CommandBus`
to send commands from client to server. **This is not possible anymore!**
Commands are now just the same as events, you can use them on the client side
and server side the same way, **BUT** if you want "type safety" when sending
a command from client to server, you have to check it yourself within the server
method. See the updated TodoMVC example.

### 4.3.2
Introduces the concept of non-reactive default state for stores and mediators
so that state is not always overwritten by default values when some reactive
dependency triggers a re-run of the `setInitialState` method. If you have default
values for the state use `setDefaultState` instead. This method is only run once
when the instance is created, after the dependencies were injected.

### 4.3.1
Make setting the initial state of stores and mediators reactive. This has the
benefit that one can take advantage of `Mongo.Collection#findOne` and other reactivity
features when initializing the state.

### 4.3.0
Use the new `Space.Object.mixin` capabilities to introduce the `Space.ui.Stateful`
mixin that encapsulates the state setting functionality that the store had and make
it available on mediators too.

### 4.2.1
Introduce Space.ui.Module with same mapping automation features as the previously
added Space.ui.Application

### 4.2.0
Updates to latest space package dependencies, especially to `space:messaging`
which introduced a simpler controller api for handling messages.

### 4.1.1
Fixes bug with reactivity when setting store state via `set`. It is non-reactive now.

### 4.1.0
Adds `Space.ui.Application` class with simplified api for setting up stores,
mediators and controllers.
